This project is a Turtle Racing Game built using Python's Turtle Module. Six turtles of separate fixed colours, namely, red, orange,
yellow, green, blue and purple are used and the user is asked to choose one colour. If the turtle colour chosen by the user reaches
the finishing point (the end of the canvas window) first, then the user wins, otherwise the user loses.
